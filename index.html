            <p class="content">Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental and widely studied task in the fields of computer vision and pattern
            recognition, serving as a benchmark for evaluating machine learning models. In this project, we conducted an extensive
            comparative analysis of multiple classical machine learning algorithms on the MNIST dataset, which comprises grayscale
            images of handwritten digits (0–9). Our objective was to understand and evaluate the individual strengths, limitations,
            and trade-offs of various models — namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random
            Forests, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) — with respect to both classification accuracy and computational
            efficiency.
            
            Each algorithm was trained using 60,000 labeled training images and evaluated on a separate set of 10,000 test images.
            To provide a detailed assessment beyond simple accuracy, we computed class-wise evaluation metrics such as precision,
            recall, and F1-score. These helped capture performance nuances for specific digits, particularly in cases where visual
            ambiguity made classification harder.
            
            Our experimental results reveal how different models behave under the same preprocessing and data distribution, and they
            shed light on the practical applicability of these techniques in real-world image classification scenarios. This project
            not only reinforced our understanding of fundamental ML concepts but also illustrated the importance of model selection
            based on dataset characteristics and task requirements.</p>

        This project was carried out as part of the course curriculum for CSL2050 - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning at
        Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur We would like to thank our instructor Dr. Anand and all Teaching Assistants, for
        their guidance and support throughout the project. We also acknowledge the collaborative efforts of all team members,
        without whom this project would not have been possible.
