# Handwritten Digit Recognition | PRML Course Project (IIT Jodhpur)

This project presents a comparative study of classical machine learning algorithms for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to analyze the performance of each model using standard evaluation metrics.

**Project Page**: [https://nitesh0409.github.io/prml_project_page/](https://nitesh0409.github.io/prml_project_page/)

## Dataset
- **MNIST**: 60,000 training and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0–9)

## Models Implemented
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score (per class)

## Objective
To evaluate the strengths, limitations, and trade-offs of classical ML models in image classification tasks.
